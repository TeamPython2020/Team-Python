# Drivers and Impact of Covid-19
●	What the project does
o	The Covid-19 project seeks to identify the drivers and impact of the Covid -19 pandemic within the United States, specifically focusing on political affiliation, population density and mental health impact

●	Why the project is useful
o	The project is useful to help policymakers plan for future outcomes from the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, the correlations between political affiliation and the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, can help to change the messaging from abstinence from proven methods and encourage adoption of the health guidelines.

●	How users can get started with the project
o	Users can get started with the project by accessing the following links:
▪	Program code
▪	Source data – Data used was sourced from the CDC, NY Times Harvard Dataverse and World population review 

●	Who maintains and contributes to the project:
o	Team members:
▪	Daniel Huang
▪	Karly Bland
▪	David Lado
▪	Cynthia Claudio
▪	Jeffrey DeSoto
▪	Debbie Moore-Banton

●	Instructions
o	Step 1 - Run all scripts in ‘Data Cleanse’ file. 
▪	This cleans and manipulates the source data. 
▪	combine data and ploy.py will combine state, political, and Covid-19 data and compute political affiliation as days to max for each state. The script will also create two scatter plots to show the relationship between state population density and infection speed; and political affiliation and infection speed.
o	Step 2 - Run ‘Analysis 2’ script in ‘Data Analysis 1’ folder.
▪	This runs a data analysis script. 
▪	See ‘Data Analysis Output and Code’ pdf file for code and output together.  
o	Step 3 - Run ‘Covid_Analysis_00’ script in ‘Data Analysis 2’ folder.
▪	This runs an exploratory data analysis for the aggregated data sets included in the folder.
▪	Decision tree and pairplot included to show comparison between models simultaneously.
▪	Density Vs. Days to Max covid cases, Population Vs Cases on State-by-State basis, Deaths Vs Cases on State-by-State basis.
▪	See ‘Covid_Analysis’ pdf file for code and outputs.
